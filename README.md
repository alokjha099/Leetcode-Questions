# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! I’ll be consistently adding solutions to problems that I solve, along with explanations and thought processes. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and create a portfolio of coding exercises.

## Structure

Each problem has:
- **Problem Description**: Summary of the problem.
- **Solution Explanation**: My thought process and approach.
- **Code**: Solution code.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analysis of time and space complexity.

## Categories

I’ve organized solutions by categories like **Arrays**, **Strings**, **Dynamic Programming**, etc., for easy navigation.

## Progress

This repository will be updated regularly as I solve new problems. Feel free to check back to see my progress!
