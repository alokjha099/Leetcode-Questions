#QUESTION LINK

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int i=0;
        for(int n:nums){
            if(i<2 || n!=nums[i-2]){
                nums[i++]=n;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
}

# In this question we might try diffent approch for example i tried to match n[i] with its past and forward value but it is a tidious approch instead we could try 
# simply comparing i with i-2 as the i increases always i-2 will be the same if duplicates are too many
