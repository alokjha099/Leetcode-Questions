Explanation of the Code
This code implements the Product of Array Except Self problem in Java using two auxiliary arrays: left and right. Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Initialize the Auxiliary Arrays
left[]: Stores the cumulative product of elements to the left of the current index.
Example: For nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], left = [1, 1, 2, 6].

right[]: Stores the cumulative product of elements to the right of the current index.
Example: For nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], right = [24, 12, 4, 1].

Step 2: Fill the left Array
java
Copy code
left[0] = 1; // No elements to the left of the first index, so set it to 1.
for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    left[i] = left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
}
Loop starts from i = 1 because the first index has no elements to the left.
For each i, calculate left[i] as the product of left[i-1] and the element at nums[i-1].
Example for nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]:

left[0] = 1
left[1] = left[0] * nums[0] = 1 * 1 = 1
left[2] = left[1] * nums[1] = 1 * 2 = 2
left[3] = left[2] * nums[2] = 2 * 3 = 6
Final left[]: [1, 1, 2, 6].

Step 3: Fill the right Array
java
Copy code
right[nums.length - 1] = 1; // No elements to the right of the last index, so set it to 1.
for (int i = nums.length - 2; i > -1; i--) {
    right[i] = right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
}
Loop starts from the second-to-last index (nums.length - 2) because the last index has no elements to the right.
For each i, calculate right[i] as the product of right[i+1] and the element at nums[i+1].
Example for nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]:

right[3] = 1
right[2] = right[3] * nums[3] = 1 * 4 = 4
right[1] = right[2] * nums[2] = 4 * 3 = 12
right[0] = right[1] * nums[1] = 12 * 2 = 24
Final right[]: [24, 12, 4, 1].

Step 4: Calculate the Answer
java
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    ans[i] = left[i] * right[i];
}
Multiply corresponding values of left[i] and right[i] to get the result for index i.
Example:

ans[0] = left[0] * right[0] = 1 * 24 = 24
ans[1] = left[1] * right[1] = 1 * 12 = 12
ans[2] = left[2] * right[2] = 2 * 4 = 8
ans[3] = left[3] * right[3] = 6 * 1 = 6
Final ans[]: [24, 12, 8, 6].

Step 5: Return the Answer
The ans array, which contains the product of all elements except the current one for each index, is returned as the output.

Optimizing the Code
The solution can be further optimized to use only a single array (ans) by avoiding the explicit use of left and right arrays. However, this code clearly demonstrates the logic and is a great choice for understanding the concept.

Example Input and Output
For nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]:

left = [1, 1, 2, 6]
right = [24, 12, 4, 1]
ans = [24, 12, 8, 6]
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6].
