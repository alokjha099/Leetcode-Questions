QUESTION LINK 
27. Remove Element 

class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] n, int val) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n.length;i++){
            if(n[i]!=val){
                n[count]=n[i];
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
        
    }
}

## this is one of the tricky questions where we are not only asked the count of value but after the count they will also check the n array and see if it has been 
#updated to [2,2,_,_] variation and you only need to make sure first k element have non-val values and rest could be anyvalue dont edit it and it has to be done in the 
# same array as well
